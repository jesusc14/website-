            <h1>Team Reflection</h1>

            <h3> As a team, one thing that we did really well with was our idea. While there were some areas
                that could've been more fleshed out, such as the game world and the story, sticking to a smaller scoped
                game allowed us to get really creative as time went on. Since the player is so constrained, it allowed
                us to get creative with the level design, and have progression. It also allowed us to add features mid
                development, such as the leaderboard system.</h3>

                <h3>If we had another 2 weeks to work on the game, our 3 highest priority items would be to make the pogo
                stick more fluid, improve enemy collisions with the player, and rework our leaderboard system to use
                CORS to allow http requests on WebGL. All of these items reflect issues that players have had with our
                game, or bugs that we have found from our own internal testing.</h3>
